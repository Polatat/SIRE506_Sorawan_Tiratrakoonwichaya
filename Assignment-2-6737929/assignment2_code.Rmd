## Import dataset

```{r}

library(readr)
train <- read_csv("./data/train.csv")
View(train)

```

## Install gtsummary package

```{r}

install.packages("gtsummary")

```

## Install ggplot2 package

```{r}

install.packages("ggplot2")  

```

## Install flextable package

```{r}

install.packages("flextable")

```


#Table 1

```{r}

library(gtsummary)
library(ggplot2)
library(flextable)

# Create the summary table 
table1 <- train %>%
  select(Survived, Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex, SibSp, Parch) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = Survived,
    label = list(
      SibSp ~ "Number of siblings/spouses aboard", 
      Parch ~ "Number of parents/children aboard",
      Pclass ~ "Ticket class"
    ),
    # Customize the summary statistics for numeric variables to display IQR as (Q1, Q3)
    statistic = list(
      all_continuous() ~ "{median} ({IQR})"
    )
  ) %>%
  modify_header(label = "Variable") %>%
  modify_spanning_header(all_stat_cols() ~ "Survival Status")

# Convert to flextable
table1_flex <- as_flex_table(table1)

# Print the table
print(table1_flex)
```


## Boxplot
# Age by survival
```{r}

Box_age <- ggplot (train, aes(x = as.factor(Survived), y = Age)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "salmon", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 3) +
    labs(x = "Survived", y = "Age", title = "Boxplot of Age Distribution by Survival Status with Outliers")
Box_age

```

# Fare by survival

```{r}

Box_fare <- ggplot (train, aes(x = as.factor(Survived), y = Fare)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "lightgreen", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 3) +
    labs(x = "Survived", y = "Fare", title = "Boxplot of Fare Distribution by Survival Status with Outliers")
Box_fare

```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
